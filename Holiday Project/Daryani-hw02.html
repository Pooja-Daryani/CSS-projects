	<h3>Productive things to do during the Holidays</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Develop healthy habits.Good habits</b></dt>
				<dd><span class="author">Nathaniel Emmons</span> once said, <q>Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters.</q> The best way to live a healthy life is to eat healthy and do more active physical activities. Healthy eating and exercising has a big impact on your future success, remaining in a healthy body, and preventing obesity or overweight. Eating healthy and doing more physical activities is a rule everyone should live by and it brings many benefits to your life.These are possible habits to develop this school holiday:
					<ul>
					<li>Daily reflection</li>
					<li>Reading for 15 minutes before bed</li>
					<li>Keeping a gratitude journal</li>
					<li>Getting on a regular sleep schedule</li>
					<li>Drinking more water</li>
					</ul>				
					</dd>
			<dt><b> Learn a new language.</b></dt>
				<dd>Language impacts the daily lives of members of any race, creed, and region of the world. Language helps express our feelings, desires, and queries to the world around us. Words, gestures and tone are utilized in union to portray a broad spectrum of emotion. The unique and diverse methods human beings can use to communicate through written and spoken language is a large part of what allows to harness our innate ability to form lasting bonds with one another; separating mankind from the rest of the animal kingdom.Creativity is increased with the study of foreign languages. Graduates often cite foreign language courses as some of the most valuable courses in college because of the communication skills developed in the process. International travel is made easier and more pleasant through knowing a foreign language.

			<dt><b>Clear your email inbox.</b></dt>
			<dd>Over the past semester, your email inbox has probably become flooded.You may even have hundreds of emails that have yet to be processed or organized.If this describes you, then read the the different articles written by fantastic article by <span class="author">Michael Hyatt</span> and implement his tips.Clearing your inbox is easier than you think. In fact, you can do it in 30 seconds, according to <span class="author">Bob Hallewell</span>, an email consultant at Expert Messaging, who has advised more than 2,000 organisations on how to change their inbox culture. "Simply set up a folder called 'Old inbox' and move every single message across. That gives you some breathing space, and gets over the psychological block that an overfilled inbox can cause. It also means you can start with a clean slate and take control of your future messages."
